# UBC-SPECIALIZATION-ANALYSIS

This project was an analysis of the UBC Science Specializations supplied by a FOI request made by reddit user /u/justausername1234.

The most prominent part of this dataset is the "Min Grade" category for each specialization that allows people to know the grade requirement needed in order to be accepted into that specialization that year. 

In my analysis, I'll look at trends in how these requirements change throughout the years and also look at if COVID affected these requirements in 2020 & 2021. 

**In summary this projet consists of 5 parts:**

Part 1 - Packages, data cleanup and aggregating Comp Sci's domestic & international averages as it is the only specialization that splits them up starting in 2018

Part 2 - Very simple data tables to get a general grasp on how the data is shown

Part 3 & 3b - Making visual plots that directly show requirements with aggregations of both UBC's groupings of specializations and my own

Part 4 - Using regression analysis and T-testing to analyze if COVID was a factor in the requirement trends in 2020 & 2021. (I did use intrapolation and extrapolation in this analysis which I know in statistics is generally frowned upon, but I couldn't think of another way to look at this data in this way)
 
Part 5 & 5b- Analyzing specialization competitiveness through the use of counting majors with requirements above a certain cutoff (this was an alternative to the direct approach to see if I could find a way to do analysis without extrapolation)

# UBC-SPECIALIZATION-ANALYSIS

This project was an analysis of the UBC Science Specializations supplied by a FOI request made by reddit user /u/justausername1234.

The most prominent part of this dataset is the "Min Grade" category for each specialization that allows people to know the grade requirement needed in order to be accepted into that specialization that year. 

In my analysis, I'll look at trends in how these requirements change throughout the years and also look at if COVID affected these requirements in 2020 & 2021.
